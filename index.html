  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>The Black Keys are an American rock band formed in Akron, Ohio, in 2001. The group consists of Dan Auerbach
    (guitar, vocals) and Patrick Carney (drums). The duo began as an independent act, recording music in basements and
    self-producing their records, before they eventually emerged as one of the most popular garage rock artists during a
    second wave of the genre's revival in the 2000s. The band's raw blues rock sound draws heavily from Auerbach's blues
    influences, including Junior Kimbrough, R.L. Burnside, Howlin' Wolf, and Robert Johnson.</p>
